Our first survey is out now! The LASA Surveyor is interested in gathering information about student's academic lives, and we ask you to please fill out the survey (which can be found at [here](https://lasasurveyor.com/survey)). 
All information will remain confidential (although Google Sign-In is required to prevent duplication) and we will publish the results on our blog and Instagram, so stay tuned. 
Posters have been hung around the school with a QR code linking to the survey, so you can also access the survey by scanning the code with your phone.
