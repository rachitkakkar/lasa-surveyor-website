At the LASA surveyor, our mission is to collect anonymous surveys of [LASA High School's](https://lasa.austinschools.org)
diverse student body and make them accessible to everyone. We ask about everything from politics to favorite foods. In the
past, we have also collaborated with other LASA clubs to collect data on their behalf. We typically run 2--5 surveys per
year, and analyze the results, which are then published here.

We are an official LASA club, and you can join us by participating on Mondays during lunch in Mr. Word's room.
