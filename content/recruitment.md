looking for individuals with experience in the following areas:

- **Web design:** HTML/CSS/Markdown/Hugo/Git
- **Data analysis/visualization:** Excel/Google Sheets/Python/R
- **Marketing/graphic design:** Canva/Photoshop
- **Other roles:** survey creation

The club has met on Mondays in the past, but we are not sure if that will be the
case next year. In either case, we would like to speak to applicants during lunch
on either April 14 or April 21 (based on your availability).
